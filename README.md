# Why every electromagnetic inversion needs a 3D forward simulation

Modern electromagnetic (EM) surveys deliver high-quality data with broad
spatial coverage and high spatial density, providing an opportunity to
produce higher-quality images of the Earth's subsurface than in the
past. Because geological structures are inherently three-dimensional,
the ultimate goal of an EM survey is to recover a 3D conductivity model
that supports robust decision-making and interpretation. Nonetheless,
practical inversion and interpretation workflows often still rely on
simplifying assumptions, such as a one-dimensional layered earth or
parametric targets like plates. This paper illustrates the value of
incorporating 3D forward simulation into the interpretation workflow. By
running a forward simulation for the EM responses of inversion-derived
models in full 3D, practitioners can assess the consistency of inversion
results with the measured data and identify potential artifacts. Using
two examples: a dipping conductor and a porphyry-style deposit, we
demonstrate how models that appear plausible under 1D assumptions fail
under 3D scrutiny. Identifying areas where 1D assumptions fail can
prompt additional analysis, such as iterative hypothesis testing or more
focussed 3D inversions. As such, 3D forward simulation should be
considered an essential tool in the EM practitioner's toolbox.
