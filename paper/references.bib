  abstract = {Surface transient electromagnetic (TEM) data with large transmitter loops for deep mineral exploration are often complicated by the non-trivial coupling between extended sources and arbitrarily oriented geological targets. This case study reports a TEM field data set acquired across terranes with strong lateral inhomogeneity, which is responsible for the high inconsistency in TEM data patterns along the survey line, as well as for the negative TEM transients (sign reversal) at some near-central loop stations. 3D forward modeling and inversion, as maturing tools in recent years, offer unique opportunities to extract as much geological information from such data as possible. 3D forward simulations of representative synthetic models found that the phenomenon of sign reversal at some TEM stations is associated with compact conductors enclosed by the transmitter loop and receivers that are in the loop, but off the conductor--a situation that is common in large-loop TEM and can only be explained by 3D models. However, 3D inversion of the field data with a uniform subspace as the initial and reference model fails to converge, another point of evidence that 3D inversions of large-loop TEM data are more likely to be subject to stability issues. Our solution is to warm-start the inversion with the representative model in the forward simulation experiments as the initial model, so the ill-posed 3D inversion can escape from local minima. Finally, the vertical contact structure in our 3D-inversion model is verified by a resistivity cross section of the CSAMT method. Our case study demonstrates the demand and capability of 3D electromagnetic modeling and inversion for high-resolution deep mineral exploration. It also provides an easy-to-follow template for carrying out 3D interpretation for complex geology in practice.},

  abstract = {Time-domain airborne surveys gather hundreds of thousands of multichannel, multicomponent samples. The volume of data and other complications have made 1D inversions and transforms the only viable method to interpret these data, in spite of their limitations. We have developed a practical methodology to perform full 3D inversions of entire time- or frequency-domain airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys. Our methodology is based on the concept of a moving footprint that reduces the computation requirements by several orders of magnitude. The 3D AEM responses and sensitivities are computed using a frequency-domain total field integral equation technique. For time-domain AEM responses and sensitivities, the frequency-domain responses and sensitivities are transformed to the time domain via a cosine transform and convolution with the system waveform. We demonstrate the efficiency of our methodology with a model study relevant to the Abitibi greenstone belt and a case study from the Reid-Mahaffy test site in Ontario, Canada, which provided an excellent practical opportunity to compare 3D inversions for different AEM systems. In particular, we compared 3D inversions of VTEM-35 (time-domain helicopter), MEGATEM II (time-domain fixed-wing), and DIGHEM (frequency-domain helicopter) data. Our comparison showed that each system is able to image the conductive overburden and to varying degrees, detect and delineate the bedrock conductors, and, as expected, that the DIGHEM system best resolved the conductive overburden, whereas the time-domain systems most clearly delineated the bedrock conductors. Our comparisons of the helicopter and fixed-wing time-domain systems revealed that the often-cited disadvantages of a fixed-wing system (i.e., response asymmetry) are not inherent in the system, but rather reflect a limitation of the 1D interpretation methods used to date.},

  abstract = {Time-domain electromagnetic (TEM) data are inverted to produce a conductivity model composed of horizontal layers of constant conductivity. The data can be values of the time decay of the vertical component of the magnetic field, or of its time derivative, measured at points either inside or outside a rectangular transmitter loop. Our inversion allows many more layers than there are data. This means that the constructed conductivity model not only fits the data to the required level, but also possesses particular characteristics. By suitable choice of the objective function to be minimized, our constructed model may have minimum structure in some well-defined sense and/or it may be close to some known background model. Our inversion algorithm works directly in the time domain. This requires fractionally more computing time than the alternative approach of transforming the data to the frequency domain before inversion. However, working in the time domain prevents distortion of the data and their associated measurement errors which may arise during the transformation. Also, the effects of the full transmitter current waveform can easily be incorporated by convolution in the time domain. Our inversion is applied to data from an environmental survey and the results are shown to compare favourably with a nearby well-log.},

  abstract = {Time-domain-induced polarization has significantly broadened its field of reference during the last decade, from mineral exploration to environmental geophysics, e.g., for clay and peat identification and landfill characterization. Though, insufficient modeling tools have hitherto limited the use of time-domain-induced polarization for wider purposes. For these reasons, a new forward code and inversion algorithm have been developed using the full-time decay of the induced polarization response, together with an accurate description of the transmitter waveform and of the receiver transfer function, to reconstruct the distribution of the Cole-Cole parameters of the earth. The accurate modeling of the transmitter waveform had a strong influence on the forward response, and we showed that the difference between a solution using a step response and a solution using the accurate modeling often is above 100\%. Furthermore, the presence of low-pass filters in time-domain-induced polarization instruments affects the early times of the acquired decays (typically up to 100~ms) and has to be modeled in the forward response to avoid significant loss of resolution. The developed forward code has been implemented in a 1D laterally constrained inversion algorithm that extracts the spectral content of the induced polarization phenomenon in terms of the Cole-Cole parameters. Synthetic examples and field examples from Denmark showed a significant improvement in the resolution of the parameters that control the induced polarization response when compared to traditional integral chargeability inversion. The quality of the inversion results has been assessed by a complete uncertainty analysis of the model parameters; furthermore, borehole information confirm the outcomes of the field interpretations. With this new accurate code in situ time-domain-induced polarization measurements give access to new applications in environmental and hydrogeophysical investigations, e.g., accurate landfill delineation or on the relation between Cole-Cole and hydraulic parameters.},

  abstract = {Airborne time-domain electromagnetic surveys are effective tools for mineral exploration and geologic mapping. 3D inversion of airborne electromagnetic data is a challenging computational problem. The size of the surveys and the spatial resolution required to adequately discretize the transmitters and receivers results in very large meshes. Solving the forward problem repeatedly on such a mesh can quickly become impractical. Fortunately, using a single mesh for both the forward and inverse problem for all of the transmitters is not necessary. The forward problem for a single source or a small group of sources can be solved on different meshes, each of which only needs to be locally refined close to the selected transmitters and receivers. Away from the selected transmitters and receivers, the mesh can be coarsened. The forward problem can then be broken into a number of highly parallel problems. Each forward modelling mesh is optimized specifically to the selected transmitters and receivers and has far fewer cells than the fine inversion mesh. Further efficiency can be gained by using stochastic Gauss--Newton methods where a stochastic approximation to the gradient, Hessian or both are used. In this paper, we present new algorithms for airborne data inversion and their implementation using a finite volume discretization on OcTree meshes. We demonstrate our approach on a large-scale synthetic versatile time-domain electromagnetic surveying data set.},

The forward problem is solved using finite volume methods in the spatial domain and an implicit method (Backward Euler) in the time domain. A modified Gauss-Newton strategy is employed to solve the inverse problem. The modifications include the use of a quasi-Newton method to generate a pre-conditioner for the perturbed system, and implementing an iterative Tikhonov approach in the solution to the inverse problem. In addition, we show how the size of the inverse problem can be reduced through a corrective source procedure. The same procedure can correct for discretization errors that inevidably arise. We also show how the inverse problem can be efficiently carried out even when the decay time for the conductor is significantly larger than the repetition time of the transmitter wave form. This requires a second processor to carry an additional forward modelling. Our inversion algorithm is general and is applicable for any electromagnetic field (E, H, dB/dt) measured in the air, on the ground, or in boreholes, and from an arbitrary grounded or ungrounded source. Three synthetic examples illustrate the basic functionality of the algorithm, and a result from a field example shows applicability in a larger-scale field example.},

  abstract = {Simulations and inversions of electromagnetic geophysical data are paramount for discerning meaningful information about the subsurface from these data. Depending on the nature of the source electromagnetic experiments may be classified as time-domain or frequency-domain. Multiple heterogeneous and sometimes anisotropic physical properties, including electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, may need be considered in a simulation. Depending on what one wants to accomplish in an inversion, the parameters which one inverts for may be a voxel-based description of the earth or some parametric representation that must be mapped onto a simulation mesh. Each of these permutations of the electromagnetic problem has implications in a numerical implementation of the forward simulation as well as in the computation of the sensitivities, which are required when considering gradient-based inversions. This paper proposes a framework for organizing and implementing electromagnetic simulations and gradient-based inversions in a modular, extensible fashion. We take an object-oriented approach for defining and organizing each of the necessary elements in an electromagnetic simulation, including: the physical properties, sources, formulation of the discrete problem to be solved, the resulting fields and fluxes, and receivers used to sample to the electromagnetic responses. A corresponding implementation is provided as part of the open source simulation and parameter estimation project SIMPEG (http://simpeg.xyz). The application of the framework is demonstrated through two synthetic examples and one field example. The first example shows the application of the common framework for 1D time domain and frequency domain inversions. The second is a field example that demonstrates a 1D inversion of electromagnetic data collected over the Bookpurnong Irrigation District in Australia. The final example is a 3D example which shows how the modular implementation is used to compute the sensitivity for a parametric model where a transmitter is positioned inside a steel cased well.},

  abstract = {We develop a procedure to invert time domain induced polarization (IP) data for inductive sources. Our approach is based upon the inversion methodology in conventional electrical IP (EIP), which uses a sensitivity function that is independent of time. However, significant modifications are required for inductive source IP (ISIP) because electric fields in the ground do not achieve a steady state. The time-history for these fields needs to be evaluated and then used to define approximate IP currents. The resultant data, either a magnetic field or its derivative, are evaluated through theBiot-Savart law. This forms the desired linear relationship between data and pseudo-chargeability. Our inversion procedure has three steps: (1) Obtain a 3-D background conductivity model. We advocate, where possible, that this be obtained by inverting early-time data that do not suffer significantly from IP effects. (2) Decouple IP responses embedded in the observations by forward modelling the TEM data due to a background conductivity and subtracting these from the observations. (3) Use the linearized sensitivity function to invert data at each time channel and recover pseudo-chargeability. Post-interpretation of the recovered pseudo-chargeabilities at multiple times allows recovery of intrinsic Cole-Cole parameters such as time constant and chargeability. The procedure is applicable to all inductive source survey geometries but we focus upon airborne time domain EM (ATEM) data with a coincident-loop configuration because of the distinctive negative IP signal that is observed over a chargeable body. Several assumptions are adopted to generate our linearized modelling butwe systematically test the capability and accuracy of the linearization for ISIP responses arising from different conductivity structures. On test examples we show: (1) our decoupling procedure enhances the ability to extract information about existence and location of chargeable targets directly from the data maps; (2) the horizontal location of a target body can be well recovered through inversion; (3) the overall geometry of a target body might be recovered but for ATEM data a depth weighting is required in the inversion; (4) we can recover estimates of intrinsic \${$\tau\$$} and \${$\eta\$$} that may be useful for distinguishing between two chargeable targets.},

We have developed a finite-volume solution to the 3D time-domain electromagnetic forward modeling problems using unstructured Delaunay-Vorono\"i dual meshes. We consider the Helmholtz equation for the electric field and a combination of the Helmholtz equation and the conservation of charge equation for the magnetic vector (A) and electric scalar ({$\phi$}) potentials. The A-{$\phi$} formulation requires initial values for A that can be obtained by solving the magnetostatic problem. We use backward Euler time stepping to advance the electric field and the potentials in the time domain. When using the potential method, the electric and magnetic fields are calculated from A-{$\phi$} solutions. To obtain consistent potential solutions at different time steps, we enforce the Coulomb gauge condition, using implicit and explicit methods. We validate the proposed method with a simple 3D conductive block model and with a comparison with other numerical methods. By using A-{$\phi$} potentials, it is possible to decompose the electric field into galvanic and inductive parts, which is helpful in understanding the physics behind the behavior of the electromagnetic fields in the ground. We use vector plots to visualize the decomposed electric fields for horizontal and vertical thin conductor models with inductive loop sources. This allows the interplay between inductive and galvanic parts as the electric field and current density develop with time to be visualized.},

The technique, first introduced by Wang et al. for causal and diffusive electromagnetic (EM) fields and subsequently implemented by Zhdanov \&amp; Portniaguine in the framework of iterative migration, is based upon imaging methods originally developed for seismic wavefields (Claerbout; Tarantola). In this paper, we advance the original derivations of Wang et al. and Zhdanov \&amp; Portniaguine to treat non-causal TEM fields, as well as correct a flaw in the theory for treatment of magnetic field data. Our 3-D imaging scheme is based on a conjugate-gradient search for the minimum of an error functional involving EM measurements governed by Maxwell's equations without displacement currents. Treatment for magnetic field, voltage (time derivative of the magnetic field) and electric field data is given. Small model perturbations in the functional can be efficiently computed by propagating the data errors back into the model in reverse time along with a DC field, sourced by the integrated data errors over the measurement time range. By correlating these fields, including the time-integrated back-propagated fields, with the corresponding incident field and its initial value at each image point, efficient computational forms for the gradients are developed. The forms of the gradients allow for additional efficiencies when voltage and electric field data are inverted. In such instances, the combined data errors can be back-propagated jointly, significantly reducing the computation time required to solve the inverse problem. The inversion algorithm is applied to the long offset transient electromagnetic (LOTEM) measurement configuration thereby demonstrating its capability in inverting non-causal field measurements of electric field and voltage, sourced by a grounded wire, over complex structures. Findings also show that migration, without iteration or preconditioning, is not an effective imaging strategy; reconstructions at the first inversion iteration bear little resemblance to simple or complex test models.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we invert magnetic, DC resistivity, induced polarization (IP), and airborne electromagnetic (EM) data from the Mt. Milligan copper-gold porphyry deposit and jointly interpret the inversion results with available geological and mineralization data. The inversions are carried out over an area that encloses an intrusive stock, known as the MBX Stock, and the resulting mineralization zone surrounding it. The earth model is discretized into a large number of cells having constant physical properties, and distributions of magnetic susceptibility, conductivity, and chargeability are obtained by minimizing a model objective function subject to adequately fitting the corresponding data. A 3-D magnetic susceptibility model is obtained directly by inverting surface total field anomaly data. 3-D conductivity and chargeability models are formed by compositing 2-D sections recovered by inverting DC/IP pole-dipole data. The airborne EM data are inverted with a 1-D algorithm and composited into a 3-D conductivity model. The physical property models are compared with a rock model constructed from geologic information from 600 drill holes and with a 3-D model of gold concentration. The physical property models have features that correlate with various geologic boundaries and rock units. More notably, the recovered chargeability and susceptibility seem to reflect the distribution of mineralization: chargeability highs coincide with the greatest gold concentration, while the susceptibility displays an anticorrelation with it. Overall, our inversion results are consistent with the geology and mineralization models for the Cu-Au porphyry deposit, while the anticorrelation between gold concentration and susceptibility provides an important constraint that helps define the distribution and geochemical control of the orebody.},

  abstract = {We present an efficient numerical method for the simulation of transient electromagnetic fields resulting from magnetic and electric dipole sources in three dimensions.The method we propose is based on the Fourier synthesis of frequency domain solutions at a sufficient number of discrete frequencies obtained using a finite element (FE) approximation of the damped vector wave equation obtained after Fourier transforming Maxwell's equations in time. We assume the solution to be required only at a few points in the computational domain, whose number is small relative to the number of FE degrees of freedom. The mapping which assigns to each frequency the FE approximation at these points of interest is a vector-valued rational function known as the transfer function. Its evaluation is approximated using Krylov subspace projection, a standard model reduction technique. Computationally, this requires the FE discretization at a small number of reference frequencies and the generation of a sufficiently large Krylov subspace associated with each reference frequency. Once a basis of this subspace is available, a sufficiently accurate rational approximation of the transfer function can be evaluated at the remaining frequencies at negligible cost. These partial frequency domain solutions are then synthesized to the time evolution at the points of interest using a fast Hankel transform.To test the algorithm, responses obtained by2-D and 3-D FE formulations have been calculated for a layered half-space and compared with results obtained analytically, for which we observed a maximum deviation of less than 2 per cent in the case of transient EM modelling. We complete our model studies with a number of comparisons with established numerical approaches.A first implementation of our new numerical algorithm already gives very good results using much less computational time compared with time stepping methods and comparable times and accuracy compared with the Spectral Lanczos Decomposition Method (SLDM).},

  abstract = {We have developed the open-source toolbox custEM (customizable electromagnetic modeling) for the simulation of complex 3D controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) problems. It is based on the open-source finite-element library FEniCS, which supports tetrahedral meshes, multiprocessing, higher order polynomials, and anisotropy. We use multiple finite-element approaches to solve the time-harmonic Maxwell equations, which are based on total or secondary electric field and gauged potential formulations. In addition, we develop a secondary magnetic field formulation, showing superior performance if only magnetic fields are required. Using N\'ed\'elec basis functions, we robustly incorporate the current density on the edges of the mesh for the total field formulations. The latter enable modeling of CSEM problems taking topography into account. We evaluate semianalytical 1D layered-earth solutions with the pyhed library, supporting arbitrary configurations of dipole or loop sources for secondary field calculations. All system matrices have been modified to be symmetric and solved in parallel with the direct solver MUMPS. Aside from the finite-element kernel, mesh generation, interpolation, and visualization modules have been implemented to simplify and automate the modeling workflow. We prove the capability of custEM, including validation against analytic-solutions, crossvalidation of all implemented approaches, and results for a model with 3D topography with four examples. The object-oriented implementation allows for customizable modifications and additions or to use only submodules designed for special tasks, such as mesh generation or matrix assembly. Therefore, the toolbox is suitable for crossvalidation with other codes and as the basis for developing 3D inversion routines.},

  abstract = {In the period from 2008 to 2012, the topic of electromagnetic (EM) induction methods applied to mineral exploration has been the subject of more than 50 papers in journals and more than 300 extended abstracts presented at conferences (about 100 of which contain developments worthy of mentioning). Most of the work at the universities has been on modelling, inversion and data processing, and most of this material is published in the refereed literature. However, academia has also undertaken work on system geometry changes, system calibration and sensor design. There have been papers describing new systems developed for mineral exploration and case histories describing the use of EM methods to directly discover mineral deposits or to map the geology. Most of this work is by the service companies and mining companies and reported in the unrefereed literature. Since 2008, the pace of development of helicopter time-domain systems has slowed and more effort has been directed to developing natural source magnetic systems and to modelling and inverting this data. A number of studies comparing the results from natural source methods with the results from artificial source methods conclude that the natural source methods can see large-scale geological structures usually when there is a weak conductivity contrast with the surrounding material, but the natural source methods are unable to see small features that have a very large conductivity contrast with the country rock. Hence, they are not a good detector of mineral deposits unless one is looking for a large porphyry system.},

  abstract = {Large-scale modelling of 3-D controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) surveys used to be feasible only for large companies and research consortia. This has changed over the last few years, and today there exists a selection of different open-source codes available to everyone. Using four different codes in the Python ecosystem, we perform simulations for increasingly complex models in a shallow marine setting. We first verify the computed fields with semianalytical solutions for a simple layered model. Then we validate the responses of a more complex block model by comparing results obtained from each code. Finally, we compare the responses of a real-world model with results from the industry. On the one hand, these validations show that the open-source codes are able to compute comparable CSEM responses for challenging, large-scale models. On the other hand, they show many general and methoddependent problems that need to be faced for obtaining accurate results. Our comparison includes finite-element and finite-volume codes using structured rectilinear and octree meshes as well as unstructured tetrahedral meshes. Accurate responses can be obtained independently of the chosen method and the chosen mesh type. The runtime and memory requirements vary greatly based on the choice of iterative or direct solvers. However, we have found that much more time was spent on designing the mesh and setting up the simulations than running the actual computation. The challenging task is, irrespective of the chosen code, to appropriately discretize the model. We provide three models, each with their corresponding discretization and responses of four codes, which can be used for validation of new and existing codes. The collaboration of four code maintainers trying to achieve the same task brought in the end all four codes a significant step further. This includes improved meshing and interpolation capabilities, resulting in shorter runtimes for the same accuracy. We hope that these results may be useful for the CSEM community at large and that we can build over time a suite of benchmarks that will help to increase the confidence in existing and new 3-D CSEM codes.},

  abstract = {We inverted airborne time-domain electromagnetic (ATEM) data over a porphyry deposit in central British Columbia, Canada and recovered the 3D electrical conductivity structure. Full 3D inversion was required because of the circular geometry of the deposit. Typical analysis, which assumes a homogeneous or layered earth, produces conductive artifacts that are contrary to geologic expectations. A synthetic example showed that those misleading artifacts arise by assuming a 1D layered earth and that a 3D inversion can successfully solve the problem. Because of the computational challenges of solving the 3D inversion with many transmitters of airborne survey, we introduced a work flow that uses a multimesh strategy to handle the field data. In our inversion, a coarse mesh and a small number of soundings are first used to rapidly reconstruct a large-scale distribution of conductivity. The mesh is then refined and more soundings are incorporated to better resolve small-scale features. This strategy significantly speeds up the 3D inversion. The progressive refinement of the mesh also helps find the resolution limit of the data and an appropriate mesh for inversion, thus overcomputing on an unnecessarily fine mesh can be avoided. The final conductivity structure has features that emulate the expected geologic structure for a porphyry system and this substantiates the need and capability for working in 3D. However, the necessity for using 3D can depend upon the EM system used. A previous 1D interpretation of frequency-domain EM data at Mt. Milligan indicated a resistive stock. We reconciled this result with the present by computing the footprints of the frequency and time-domain surveys. The distribution of currents for the frequency-domain system was smaller than the length scale of the geologic target while the opposite was true for the time-domain data.},

  abstract = {Numerical modeling and inversion of electromagnetic (EM) data is a computationally intensive task. To achieve efficiency, we have developed algorithms that were constructed from a smallest practical computational unit. This ``atomic'' building block, which yields the solution of Maxwell's equations for a single time or frequency datum due to an infinitesimal current or magnetic dipole, is a self-contained EM problem that can be solved independently and inexpensively on a single core of CPU. Any EM data set can be composed from these units through assembling or superposition. This approach takes advantage of the rapidly expanding capability of multiprocessor computation. Our decomposition has allowed us to handle the computational complexity that arises because of the physical size of the survey, the large number of transmitters, and the large range of time or frequency in a data set; we did this by modeling every datum separately on customized local meshes and local time-stepping schemes. The counterpart to efficiency with atomic decomposition was that the number of independent subproblems could become very large. We have realized that not all of the data need to be considered at all stages of the inversion. Rather, the data can be significantly downsampled at late times or low frequencies and at the early stages of inversion when only long-wavelength signals are sought. We have therefore developed a random data subsampling approach, in conjunction with cross-validation, that selects data in accordance to the spatial scales of the EM induction and the degree of regularization. Alternatively, for many EM surveys, the atomic units can be combined into larger subproblems, thus reducing the number of subproblems needed. These trade-offs were explored for airborne and ground large-loop systems with specific survey configurations being considered. Our synthetic and field examples showed that the proposed framework can produce 3D inversion results in uncompromised quality in a more scalable manner.},
